Jumeaux for VSCode
==================

> Code fancily, write humbly. VSCode themes for two personalities.

**Jumeaux** (`/ʒy.mo/`) is a set of themes for Visual Studio Code. It combines
themes for two different use cases:

- **Jumeaux Colorés** — colourful themes for coding. Highlights keywords and
                        code units based on their type and usage.  
                        Inspired by [One Dark] and [Material] themes.

- **Jumeaux Pâles**   — pale themes for writing. Makes use of bold and italics
                        to mark important spots.  
                        Inspired by [Alabaster], [iA Writer], and [Writer]
                        themes.

Both themes have a _Claires_ and a _Foncés_ variation, for the day and the
night.
